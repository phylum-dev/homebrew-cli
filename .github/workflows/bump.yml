# This is a workflow for bumping the CLI version references in the Formula and creating a PR with the changes.
#
# It is configured to be triggered by repository dispatch events which come from outside of this repository.
# It requires write access to the repository by providing a personal access token (PAT) with `repo` scope.
#
# The `event_type` parameter is expected to be `trigger-bump-formula-pr`.
# The `client_payload` parameter is expected to contain the following data:
#   * `CLI_version`: a string containing the Phylum CLI version to include
#                    in the formula, with or without the leading `v` (e.g., v4.7.0)
#
# Here is an example repository dispatch event, triggered with `curl` from the command line:
#
# curl \
#   -X POST \
#   --fail-with-body \
#   -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
#   -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
#   -H "Authorization: token <PAT>" \
#   -d '{"event_type":"trigger-bump-formula-pr","client_payload":{"CLI_version":"v4.7.0"}}' \
